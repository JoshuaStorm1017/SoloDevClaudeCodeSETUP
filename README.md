# Solo Developer Claude Configuration

This folder contains optimized Claude configurations for solo developers who need speed, debugging capabilities, and progress tracking.

## 📁 What's Included

### Configuration Files
- **CLAUDE-solo-dev.md** - Basic fast-moving solo dev config
- **CLAUDE-solo-dev-smart.md** - Enhanced config with AI debugging documentation
- **CLAUDE-solo-dev-tracking.md** - Full system with progress/debug logging

### Commands
- **ship-it.md** - Quick implementation without over-engineering
- **debug-this.md** - Smart debugging with assumption tracking

### Tools
- **create-log.sh** - Script to create numbered progress/debug logs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Smart Tracking System (Recommended)
```bash
# Copy to your project
cp CLAUDE-solo-dev-tracking.md ~/your-project/CLAUDE.md

# Create logs directory
mkdir ~/your-project/_logs

# Copy the log creation script
cp create-log.sh ~/your-project/
chmod +x ~/your-project/create-log.sh
```

### Option 2: Simple Smart Config
```bash
# Just the debugging-aware config
cp CLAUDE-solo-dev-smart.md ~/your-project/CLAUDE.md
```

### Option 3: Command Line Alias
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias claude-solo='claude-code --system-prompt "$(cat ~/Desktop/Master\ Claude/SoloDev/CLAUDE-solo-dev-tracking.md)"'
```

## 📝 Progress Logging System

The tracking system creates numbered logs like:
```
_logs/
├── 001_initial_setup.md
├── 002_add_auth_system.md
├── 003_debug_login_timeout.md
└── 004_add_payments.md
```

### Create a Log Entry
```bash
./create-log.sh
# Follow prompts to create feature or debug log
```

### Example Log Entry
```markdown
# 003 - Debug Login Timeout
Date: 2024-01-16
Type: debug

## What I Fixed
- Login was taking 30+ seconds
- Users getting timeout errors

## Root Cause
- N+1 query in permission loading
- Loading each role's permissions separately

## Code Locations
- Fixed in: src/auth/permissions.ts
- Added index: migrations/add_role_index.sql

## Verification
- Login time: 30s -> 200ms
- Added test: tests/auth/performance.test.ts
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Starting Work
```
"Check _logs/ for recent work and continue development"
```

### After Building Features
```
"Create a progress log for the payment system we just built"
```

### When Debugging
```
"Login is broken. Check logs for previous auth issues and fix"
```

### Quick Implementation
```
"/ship-it user avatar upload"
```

### Smart Debugging
```
"/debug-this users can't see their dashboards"
```
