# Ship It Command

When I use `/ship-it`, that means:

1. Implement the feature I described
2. Make it work (doesn't have to be perfect)
3. Basic error handling only  
4. Skip extensive tests (I'll test manually)
5. Show me the changes
6. Let me handle deployment

Priorities:
- Speed > Perfection
- Working > Optimal
- Done > Discussed

Just build what I asked for and move on.
